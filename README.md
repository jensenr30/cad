# JensenR30's Schematics and PCBs (printed circuit boards)

## kicad5
I started using KiCad 5.1.2 to draw schematics and lay out PCBs in May 2019.


## kicad4
I used KiCad 4.0.6 for 3 weeks in September 2017. The two projects I completed are:
* [Shift-Register Break-Out-Board](/kicad4/SRBOB) - A modular daisy-chain-able serial-in-parallel-out 74hc595-based shift register circuit board.
* [XPhone Input Board](/kicad4/XPhone/Input_Board) - A quad transducer amplifier and glockenspiel-key-hit-detection circuit board.


## eagle6
Eagle was the first CAD program I ever used. I started using Eagle (on version 5.11.0) sometime in early 2011. I stopped using Eagle (on version 6.6.0) in 2017.  Some of the more interesting projects I completed are:
* [Analog Synth](eagle6/Analog%20Synth) - a bunch of analog (and digital) DIY synth modules.  Designed, built, and tested by your truly.  This includes VCOs, VCFs, VCAs, sequencers, front-panel designs, digital delay, manual oscillators, and power-distribution interconnect PCBs.
* [Stroboscope](eagle6/Stroboscope) - a device that can turn on and off LEDs very fast (at audio frequencies) in order to produce interesting/useful/helpful visual effects.  A stroboscope can be used to enable a human to monitor the rotation of things in real time, e.g. fans, drills, wheels, motors, spinning objects, guitar strings, and any other object engaged in cyclic motion.
* [VU Meter](eagle6/VU%20meter) - a circuit that represents audio amplitude vertically on several bargraphs (each bargraph displays the amplitude of a given section of the audio spectrum).  The device can be used to build a real-time visual audio spectrum analyzer.
* [FreqCount84](eagle6/FreqCount84) - Atmel microcontroller-based design for precise measurement of frequency of square waves.  I believe the hwardware & firmware achieved an accuracy of ± a few ppm with the help of a 1.5 pm TCXO.
* [9x9 LED Matrix](eagle6/9x9%20LED%20Matrix) - a 2D array of LEDs (9 LEDs wide, 9 LEDs tall).  I remember wanting to build an array that had an odd number of pixels because it would allow me to make symetric visual displays.  I programmed a game of pong for this 9x9 LED Matrix.  That code exists in [my repo for Arduino programs](https://github.com/jensenr30/Arduino/tree/master/_DISPLAY/9x9_LED_Matrix).
* [Prototype Boards](eagle6/Prototype%20Boards) - three PCBs that enable DIY circuit construction.  0.1"-arrays of SMD pads, 0.1"-arrays of through-holes, SOT-to-DIP break-out-boards, SOIC-to-DIP break-out-boards, etc...
